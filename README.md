Students Performance Analysis using Tableau

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance dataset (math, reading, writing scores) using Tableau.
The goal is to explore how demographic factors (gender, lunch type, parental education, and test preparation) influence academic outcomes.
An interactive Tableau Dashboard was built for clear visualization and insights.

ðŸŽ¯ KPI Requirements

1. Total Students: Count of students in the dataset.
2. Average Scores: Mean of math, reading, and writing scores.
3. Performance Tiers: Categorize students into performance bands (High, Medium, Low).
4. Survival-style Metric (Pass Rate): % of students scoring above threshold (e.g., â‰¥ 50).

ðŸ“Š Visualizations in Dashboard

1. Filters: Gender, Test Preparation, Parental Education
2. Line Chart: Average scores by parental education level
3. Bar Chart: Performance tiers across ethnic groups
4. Pie Chart: Proportion of students by lunch type or test prep status
5. Score Tracker: Dynamic KPI cards to track average subject scores
6. Top Scorers: Highlight students with highest total scores per demographic group
7. Heatmap: Performance distribution across Math, Reading, Writing combinations

ðŸ”Ž Project Insights

1. Students who completed test preparation scored higher across all subjects.
2. Parental education level is positively correlated with higher student performance.
3. Females outperformed males in reading and writing, while males slightly led in math.
4. Students with standard lunch showed better performance compared to those with free/reduced lunch.
5. The heatmap highlights clusters of high achievers and at-risk students.
